      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      const newTeam = [...players]
      console.log(players,newTeam)

      newTeam[2] = "changed"

      console.log(players,newTeam,)

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      let newTeam1 = players.slice()
      console.log(newTeam1)
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      let newTeam2=[].concat(players)
      console.log(newTeam2)
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let newTeam3=[...players]
      console.log(newTeam3)
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      newTeam[3] = 'heee haw'
      console.log(newTeam)
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
       const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        number:20
      };
      console.log(person)
      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person
      captain.number = 99
      console.log(person)
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99,age:12})
      console.log(cap2)

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = {...person}
      console.log(cap3)
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
